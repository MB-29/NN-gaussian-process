# Neural Networks as Gaussian Processes


A NumPy implementation of the bayesian inference approach of [Deep Neural Networks as Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00165).

We focus on infinitely wide neural network endowed with ReLU nonlinearity function, allowing for an analytic computation of the layer kernels.
